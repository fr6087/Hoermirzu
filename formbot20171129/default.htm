    <p>LuisBot implements diffrent features of Microsoft Bot Framework's FormFlow: it shows
    how to generate a form dialoge from the file "JsonDummyForBot.json" and how to connect multiple
    dialogs by options. Also there are functions for gernerating localized dialogs.</p>
    <p>
        You can run this bot in the Cortana canvas, if you set your device's language and region's settings
        to USA and are within the group of users to which the bot was published. Type "ask formbot" in the Cortana Canvas to give it a try.
        There is also the possibility to connect via DirectLine to this bot. This is shown in one of this
        project's sibling projects, WCFService1.
